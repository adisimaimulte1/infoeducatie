# file containing the robot's trail logic.
#
# we define the trail as the array of points representing positions in time, stored in a list.
#
# because loop time can mess up the appearance of the trail, the solution we came up was drawing a line between
#   each 2 consecutive points to ensure continuity. This further expanded to the notions of trail width and trail
#   segments.
#
# trail segments are trail parts, characterized by close-up points. We defined a threshold for a min
#   distance (in pixels) between two consecutive points, which delimits individual segments. Each segment
#   has a color and a width. The only way to get a new segment is, somehow, register a position further 
#   than the threshold, which can be done by turning ON and OFF trail drawing.
#
# trail can have a maximum length, removing the first point from the list when reached, tho this length can
#   be set to infinity and not use this feature. 
#
# no duplicate points are stored in the list.
#
# after a time threshold of not moving, the trail can start erase itself. This can be stopped with a setting
